# Dynamic programming: Main components are Recurion and Memoization.
    * Top-down method (Memoization)
    * Botom-up method (Tabulation)
    * FAST method: Find recursive solution, Analyse the solution, Save the results for future, Tweak the solutoin to make it more powerful by eliminating recursion overhead.
